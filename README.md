`cc01` is a simple RISC written in chisel3. It only supports 32bits integer instructions. cc means chisel cat, or something else, or just cc. Never mind, just a name.

Feel free, and first of all, appreciated, to point out bugs and traps (in chinese, they can be called 虫洞). Thanks.

Now, cc01 has a website www.riscv.cn , welcome to access it.
